        //
        // (1) This flow leaks private data. If you download a transaction and then do NOT request a
        // dependency, it means you already have it, which in turn means you must have been involved with it before
        // somehow, either in the tx itself or in any following spend of it. If there were no following spends, then
        // your peer knows for sure that you were involved ... this is bad! The only obvious ways to fix this are
        // something like onion routing of requests, secure hardware, or both.
        //
        // (2) If the identity service changes the assumed identity of one of the public keys, it's possible
        // that the "tx in db is valid" invariant is violated if one of the contracts checks the identity! Should
        // the db contain the identities that were resolved when the transaction was first checked, or should we
        // accept this kind of change is possible? Most likely solution is for identity data to be an attachment.
