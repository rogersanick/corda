Official Corda Docker Image
===========================

Running a node connected to a Compatibility Zone in Docker
----------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Requirements: A valid node.conf and a valid set of certificates - (signed by the CZ)


In this example, the certificates are stored at ``/home/user/cordaBase/certificates``, the node configuration is in ``/home/user/cordaBase/config/node.conf`` and the CorDapps to run are in ``/path/to/cordapps``

.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti \
            --memory=2048m \
            --cpus=2 \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/config:/etc/corda \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/persistence:/opt/corda/persistence \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/logs:/opt/corda/logs \
            -v /path/to/cordapps:/opt/corda/cordapps \
            -p 10200:10200 \
            -p 10201:10201 \
            corda/corda-zulu-4.3-snapshot:latest

As the node runs within a container, several mount points are required:

1. CorDapps - CorDapps must be mounted at location ``/opt/corda/cordapps``
2. Certificates - certificates must be mounted at location ``/opt/corda/certificates``
3. Config - the node config must be mounted at location ``/etc/corda/node.config``
4. Logging - all log files will be written to location ``/opt/corda/logs``

If using the H2 database:

5. Persistence - the folder to hold the H2 database files must be mounted at location ``/opt/corda/persistence``

.. note:: If there is no dataSourceProperties key in the node.conf, the docker container overrides the url for H2 to point to the persistence directory by default so that the database can be accessed outside the container


Running a node connected to a Bootstrapped Network
--------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Requirements: A valid node.conf, a valid set of certificates, and an existing network-parameters file

In this example, we have previously generated a network-parameters file using the bootstrapper tool, which is stored at ``/home/user/sharedFolder/network-parameters``


.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti \
            --memory=2048m \
            --cpus=2 \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/config:/etc/corda \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/persistence:/opt/corda/persistence \
            -v /home/user/cordaBase/logs:/opt/corda/logs \
            -v /home/TeamCityOutput/cordapps:/opt/corda/cordapps \
            -v /home/user/sharedFolder/node-infos:/opt/corda/additional-node-infos \
            -v /home/user/sharedFolder/network-parameters:/opt/corda/network-parameters \
            -p 10200:10200 \
            -p 10201:10201 \
            corda/corda-zulu-4.3-snapshot:latest

There is a new mount ``/home/user/sharedFolder/node-infos:/opt/corda/additional-node-infos`` which is used to hold the ``nodeInfo`` of all the nodes within the network.
As the node within the container starts up, it will place it's own nodeInfo into this directory. This will allow other nodes also using this folder to see this new node.


Generating configs and certificates
-----------------------------------

It is possible to utilize the image to automatically generate a sensible minimal configuration for joining an existing Corda network.

Joining TestNet
---------------

.. note:: Requirements: A valid registration for TestNet and a one-time code for joining TestNet. Certificate and configuration folders should be accessible from the container. Docker will create folders using the permissions of it's daemon if they don't exist and the container may fail accessing them.

.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti \
            -e MY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS="corda-node.example.com" \
            -e ONE_TIME_DOWNLOAD_KEY="bbcb189e-9e4f-4b27-96db-134e8f592785" \
            -e LOCALITY="London" -e COUNTRY="GB" \
            -v /home/user/docker/config:/etc/corda \
            -v /home/user/docker/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            corda/corda-zulu-4.3-snapshot:latest config-generator --testnet

``$MY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS`` will be the public address that this node will be advertised on.
``$ONE_TIME_DOWNLOAD_KEY`` is the one-time code provided for joining TestNet.
``$LOCALITY`` and ``$COUNTRY`` must be set to the values provided when joining TestNet.

When the container has finished executing ``config-generator`` the following will be true

1. A skeleton, but sensible minimum node.conf is present in ``/home/user/docker/config``
2. A set of certificates signed by TestNet in ``/home/user/docker/certificates``

It is now possible to start the node using the generated config and certificates

.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti \
            --memory=2048m \
            --cpus=2 \
            -v /home/user/docker/config:/etc/corda \
            -v /home/user/docker/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            -v /home/user/docker/persistence:/opt/corda/persistence \
            -v /home/user/docker/logs:/opt/corda/logs \
            -v /home/user/corda/samples/bank-of-corda-demo/build/nodes/BankOfCorda/cordapps:/opt/corda/cordapps \
            -p 10200:10200 \
            -p 10201:10201 \
            corda/corda-zulu-4.3-snapshot:latest


Joining an existing Compatibility Zone
--------------------------------------

.. note:: Requirements: A Compatibility Zone, the Zone Trust Root and authorisation to join said Zone.

It is possible to use the image to automate the process of joining an existing Zone as detailed `here <joining-a-compatibility-zone.html#connecting-to-a-compatibility-zone>`__

The first step is to obtain the Zone Trust Root, and place it within a directory. In the below example, the Trust Root is stored at ``/home/user/docker/certificates/network-root-truststore.jks``.
It is possible to configure the name of the Trust Root file by setting the ``TRUST_STORE_NAME`` environment variable in the container.

.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti --net="host" \
            -e MY_LEGAL_NAME="O=EXAMPLE,L=Berlin,C=DE"     \
            -e MY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS="corda.example-hoster.com"       \
            -e NETWORKMAP_URL="https://map.corda.example.com"    \
            -e DOORMAN_URL="https://doorman.corda.example.com"      \
            -e NETWORK_TRUST_PASSWORD="trustPass"       \
            -e MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS="cordauser@r3.com"      \
            -v /home/user/docker/config:/etc/corda          \
            -v /home/user/docker/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            corda/corda-zulu-4.3-snapshot:latest config-generator --generic


Several environment variables must also be passed to the container to allow it to register:

1. ``MY_LEGAL_NAME`` - The X500 to use when generating the config. This must be the same as registered with the Zone.
2. ``MY_PUBLIC_ADDRESS`` - The public address to advertise the node on.
3. ``NETWORKMAP_URL`` - The address of the Zone's network map service (this should be provided to you by the Zone).
4. ``DOORMAN_URL`` - The address of the Zone's doorman service (this should be provided to you by the Zone).
5. ``NETWORK_TRUST_PASSWORD`` - The password to the Zone Trust Root (this should be provided to you by the Zone).
6. ``MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS`` - The email address to use when generating the config. This must be the same as registered with the Zone.

There are some optional variables which allow customisation of the generated config:

1. ``MY_P2P_PORT`` - The port to advertise the node on (defaults to 10200). If changed, ensure the container is launched with the correct published ports.
2. ``MY_RPC_PORT`` - The port to open for RPC connections to the node (defaults to 10201). If changed, ensure the container is launched with the correct published ports.

Once the container has finished performing the initial registration, the node can be started as normal

.. code-block:: shell

    docker run -ti \
            --memory=2048m \
            --cpus=2 \
            -v /home/user/docker/config:/etc/corda \
            -v /home/user/docker/certificates:/opt/corda/certificates \
            -v /home/user/docker/persistence:/opt/corda/persistence \
            -v /home/user/docker/logs:/opt/corda/logs \
            -v /home/user/corda/samples/bank-of-corda-demo/build/nodes/BankOfCorda/cordapps:/opt/corda/cordapps \
            -p 10200:10200 \
            -p 10201:10201 \
