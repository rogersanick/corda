   Welcome to Corda, a platform for building decentralized applications. This guidebook covers everything you need to know to create
   apps, run nodes and networks, and operate your new decentralized business network.

   If you're completely new to distributed ledger technology (DLT) or Corda and would like a business-oriented overview, we recommend
   reading the introductory white paper. If you'd like a detailed architectural description of how the Corda protocol works, why
   it's designed how it is and what future work is planned, we recommend reading the technical white paper. Both white papers can be
   found on `the Corda documentation website`_.

   But if you'd like to dive in and start writing apps, or running nodes, this guidebook is for you. It covers the open source Corda
   distribution. Commercial distributions (like Corda Enterprise from R3) have their own user guides that describe their enhanced features.

   We look forward to seeing what you can do with Corda!
